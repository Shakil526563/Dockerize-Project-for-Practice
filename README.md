I completed a comprehensive Docker course from the Code_ABC YouTube channel, designed for both beginners and advanced learners. The course covered core Docker concepts including Images, Containers, Networks, Volumes, Bind Mounts, Docker Hub, and Docker Compose. It emphasized real-world, hands-on practices, helping me gain solid practical experience in Dockerization and container orchestration using Docker Compose â€” all in Bangla for easy understanding.
